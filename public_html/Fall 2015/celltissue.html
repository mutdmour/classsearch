Their applications range from day-to-day consumables to high performance materials used in critically demanding areas, such as aviation, aerospace and medical devices.  The objective of this course is to provide an introductory overview on the field of polymer science and engineering.  Students will learn some basic concepts in polymer synthesis, characterization, and processing.  With the basic concepts established, industrial applications of polymeric materials will be discussed in two categories: structural polymers and functional polymers.  Structural polymers, including plastics, fibers, rubbers, coatings, adhesives, and composites, will be discussed in terms of their structure, processing, and property relationship with a flavor of industrial relevant products and applications.  Future trends in developing environmentally friendly polymers from renewable resources (green polymer chemistry) will also be covered.  Lectures on functional polymers will be focused on their unique properties that are enabled by rational molecular design, controlled synthesis and processing (e.g. supramolecular assembly, and microfabrication).   This class of specialty materials can find their use in high performance photovoltaics, batteries, membranes, and composites, and can also serve as smart materials for use in coatings, sensors, medical devices, and biomimicry. </td>

Class lectures include an overview of molecular biology fundamentals, protein/ligand binding, receptor/ligand trafficking, cell-cell interactions, cell-matrix interactions, and cell adhesion and migration at both theoretical and experimental levels.  Lectures will cover the effects of physical (e.g. shear stress, strain), chemical (e.g. cytokines, growth factors) and electrical stimuli on cell function, emphasizing topics on gene regulation and signal transduction processes.  Furthermore, topics in metabolic engineering, enzyme evolution, polymeric biomaterials, and drug and gene delivery will be discussed.  This course is intended as Part 1 of a two-semester sequence recommended for students in the Cell and Tissue Engineering focus area.

Mentors will also be expected to mentor specific students who are learning new techniques for the first time, contribute to the computational and biotech infrastructure associated with Build-a-Genome, and pursue at least one independent research project. Successful completion of this course provides 3 credit hours toward the supervised research requirement for Molecular and Cellular Biology majors.
