Co-listed as AS.050.203 in Cognitive Science.<br>AS.050.203 Cognitive Neuroscience: Exploring the Living Brain <br> This course surveys theory and research concerning how mental processes are carried out by the human brain. Currently a wide range of methods of probing the functioning brain are yielding insights into the nature of the relation between mental and neural events. Emphasis will be placed on developing an understanding of both the physiological bases of the techniques and the issues involved in relating measures of brain activity to cognitive functioning. Methods surveyed include electrophysiological recording techniques such as EEG, ERP, single/multiple unit recording and MEG; functional imaging techniques such as PET and fMRI; and methods that involve lesioning or disrupting neural activity such as cortical stimulation, animal lesion studies, and the study of brain-damaged individuals.

That knowledge invades our lives every day.  And decisions are made based on that knowledge from every corner of lifefrom physician to politician and every stop in between.  This course is meant to provide a fundamental understanding of how the cells and molecules as well as the regions and systems of the brain work to have you see and hear and move and remember.  The course is divided into four sections that progress from the cells of the brain and spinal cord to circuits then systems and finally behaviors.  Introduction to Neuroscience is designed for any college student who has an interest in the range of disciplines we call neuroscience.</td>

The course (and software to be developed) will cover the spectrum of factors affecting pharmaceutical bioavailability including drug formulation, mode of dosing and dosing rate, metabolism and metabolic cascades, storage in fatty tissues, and diffusional limitations (such as in crossing the blood-brain barrier or diffusional differences between normal and cancerous cells).  The goal is to develop a process model of the human body that will predict pharmaceutical bioavailability as a function of time and organ (or cell) type that will work for a wide variety of pharmaceuticals including small molecules, biologics, and chemotherapy agents. </td>

Students should have a strong ability to learn mathematics quickly and on a higher level than that of the regular Calculus sequences.Honors Single Variable Calculus <br> This is an honors alternative to the Calculus sequences AS.110.106-AS.110.107 or AS.110.108-AS.110.109 and meets the general requirement for both Calculus I and Calculus II (although the credit hours count for only one course). It is a more theoretical treatment of one variable differential and integral calculus and is based on our modern understanding of the real number system as explained by Cantor, Dedekind, and Weierstrass.

In this combination lecture/laboratory 'Synthetic Biology' course students will learn how to make DNA building blocks used in an int'l. project to build the world's first synthetic eukaryotic genome, Saccharomyces cerevisiae v. 2.0. Please study the wiki www.syntheticyeast.org for more details about the project. Following a biotechnology boot-camp, students will have 24/7 access to computational and wet-lab resources and will be expected to spend 15-20 hours per week on this course. Advanced students will be expected to contribute to the computational and biotech infrastructure. Successful completion of this course provides 3 credit hours toward the supervised research requirement for Molecular and Cellular Biology majors, or 2 credit hours toward the upper level elective requirement for Biology or Molecular and Cellular Biology majors. </td>

Introduction to Computational Medicine I is the first in a sequence of two courses on computational medicine. It covers the core concepts of computational physiological medicine and computational anatomy. The first half of this course will cover computational physiological medicine. Students will learn how to: use biophysical laws and data to formulate computational models of physiological systems in health and disease; analyze the behaviors of these models using analytical and simulation approaches; apply models to understand their use in diagnosing and treating disease. The second half of this course will cover computational anatomy. Students will learn how to: model anatomies using magnetic resonance imaging data; compare anatomies via mappings onto anatomical atlases; discover anatomical biomarkers of disease; analyze changes in the connectivity of anatomies in disease. Class time will emphasize hands-on learning through data analysis, software development, and simulation. All instructional materials will be made available at the beginning of the course. Recommended background: Calculus I-III, linear algebra, and ordinary differential equations. Proficiency in C++, Matlab or Python is required. </td>
