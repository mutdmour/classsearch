Co-listed as AS.050.203 in Cognitive Science.<br>AS.050.203 Cognitive Neuroscience: Exploring the Living Brain <br> This course surveys theory and research concerning how mental processes are carried out by the human brain. Currently a wide range of methods of probing the functioning brain are yielding insights into the nature of the relation between mental and neural events. Emphasis will be placed on developing an understanding of both the physiological bases of the techniques and the issues involved in relating measures of brain activity to cognitive functioning. Methods surveyed include electrophysiological recording techniques such as EEG, ERP, single/multiple unit recording and MEG; functional imaging techniques such as PET and fMRI; and methods that involve lesioning or disrupting neural activity such as cortical stimulation, animal lesion studies, and the study of brain-damaged individuals.

A survey of neuropsychology relating the organization of behavior to the integrative action of the nervous system. Cross-listed with Behavioral Biology and Neuroscience.<br>080.105 An Introduction to Neuroscience <br> Our knowledge of brain function from the level of single molecules to human behavior continues to expand at something approaching light speed. That knowledge invades our lives every day.  And decisions are made based on that knowledge from every corner of lifefrom physician to politician and every stop in between.  This course is meant to provide a fundamental understanding of how the cells and molecules as well as the regions and systems of the brain work to have you see and hear and move and remember.  The course is divided into four sections that progress from the cells of the brain and spinal cord to circuits then systems and finally behaviors.  Introduction to Neuroscience is designed for any college student who has an interest in the range of disciplines we call neuroscience.</td>

The World Wide Web that links us to and enables information flows with the rest of the world is the most visible example. It is, however, only one of many networks within which we are situated. Our social life is organized around networks of friends and colleagues. These networks determine our information, influence our opinions, and shape our political attitudes. They also link us, often through important but weak ties, to everybody else in the United States and in the world. Economic and financial markets also look much more like networks than anonymous marketplaces. Firms interact with the same suppliers and customers and use Web-like supply chains. Financial linkages, both among banks and between consumers, companies and banks, also form a network over which funds flow and risks are shared. Systemic risk in financial markets often results from the counterparty risks created within this financial network. Food chains, interacting biological systems and the spread and containment of epidemics are some of the other natural and social phenomena that exhibit a marked networked structure.
This course will introduce the tools for the study of networks. It will show how certain common principles permeate the functioning of these diverse networks and how the same issues related to robustness, fragility, and interlinkages arise in several different types of networks. Biological applications will be highlighted as material is presented. Recommended Course Background: EN.580.222 </td>

Mentors will also be expected to mentor specific students who are learning new techniques for the first time, contribute to the computational and biotech infrastructure associated with Build-a-Genome, and pursue at least one independent research project. Successful completion of this course provides 3 credit hours toward the supervised research requirement for Molecular and Cellular Biology majors.
