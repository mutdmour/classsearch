The course covers supervised learning (classification/structured prediction/regression/ranking), unsupervised learning (dimensionality reduction, bayesian modeling, clustering) and semi-supervised learning. Additional topics may include reinforcement learning and learning theory. The course will also consider challenges resulting from learning applications, such as transfer learning, multi-task learning and large datasets. We will cover popular algorithms (naive Bayes, SVM, perceptron, HMM, winnow, LDA, k-means, maximum entropy) and will focus on how statistical learning algorithms are applied to real world applications. Students in the course will implement several learning algorithms and develop a learning system for a final project. [Applications] Recommended Course Background: multivariate calculus. </td>
